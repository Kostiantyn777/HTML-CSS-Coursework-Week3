            Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions,
            such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless
            cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and
            many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated
            procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake
            making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment
            and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of
            cooks may bake a cake.
